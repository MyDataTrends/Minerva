# 🚀 Minerva Sales Kit: Retail & E-commerce

> **Use Case**: Autonomous Revenue Intelligence for Omnichannel Retail
> **Target Persona**: VP of Merchandising / Director of Retail Analytics

## 1. The Executive Pitch
Minerva replaces your manual reporting grind with an AI analyst that autonomously monitors your retail performance 24/7. Instead of building dashboards, just ask questions in plain English—Minerva instantly analyzes sales patterns, flags return anomalies, and surfaces which products or regions need attention, giving you boardroom-ready insights in seconds, not days.

## 2. The Pain Points (Why they buy)
* 🔴 **Spending 15+ hours weekly manually pulling reports from multiple systems to understand which products are underperforming across channels, only to present stale insights to leadership**
* 🔴 **Missing critical revenue opportunities because returns, rating trends, and regional performance issues aren't surfaced until it's too late to take action**
* 🔴 **Unable to answer executive questions like 'Why did revenue drop last week?' without scrambling the BI team for days to build custom dashboards**

## 3. The Solution: Minerva Autonomous Analyst
We don't just "show data". We solve the problem.

### 💰 ROI & Business Impact
* 🟢 Save 15-20 hours per week eliminating manual reporting and dashboard maintenance

## 4. The Golden Demo Script
*Use the dataset `demo_retail_sales.csv` for this demo.*

### Step 1: 1. Ask: 'Which product categories are underperforming this month and why?'
- **Action**: Minerva instantly segments revenue by product_category, compares period-over-period growth, and correlates with customer_rating and is_returned data
- **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: No SQL, no waiting on analysts. The VP gets a complete answer with root cause analysis (e.g., 'Electronics down 12% due to 18% return rate and 3.2 avg rating') in 8 seconds

### Step 2: 2. Ask: 'Show me return patterns by region and channel'
- **Action**: Minerva generates a breakdown showing South region Online channel has 2.3x higher return rates than In-Store, with specific product categories driving the issue
- **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: Surfaces an actionable insight they didn't know to look for—potentially a fulfillment or product listing issue costing thousands in returns

### Step 3: 3. Ask: 'Alert me when any region's revenue drops more than 15% week-over-week'
- **Action**: Minerva sets up autonomous monitoring—no dashboard to build. Next week, it proactively sends a Slack alert: 'East region revenue down 18%, driven by Home category decline'
- **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: Shifts from reactive reporting to proactive intelligence. The VP learns about problems before the CEO asks about them

### Step 4: 4. Ask: 'Create an executive summary for tomorrow's leadership meeting'
- **Action**: Minerva generates a natural language brief: 'Revenue up 8% MTD, driven by Online channel growth (+14%). Risk area: Electronics returns up 22%, concentrated in South region, avg rating dropped to 3.1—recommend inventory review'
- **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: Transforms 3 hours of manual report prep into a 30-second ask. The VP shows up to meetings with insights, not just data
