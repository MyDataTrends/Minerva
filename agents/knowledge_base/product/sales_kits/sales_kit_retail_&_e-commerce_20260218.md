## 1. The Executive Pitch
Assay is your AI data analyst that monitors your retail operations 24/7 and proactively surfaces the insights that matter—without you building a single dashboard. Instead of spending hours in spreadsheets asking 'what happened?', Assay tells you what's driving revenue changes, which products are at risk, and where to focus next, automatically.

## 2. The Pain Points (Why they buy)
* 🔴 **Spending 15+ hours weekly manually pulling data from multiple systems to answer exec questions like 'Why did revenue drop last week?' or 'Which products are underperforming?'—only to have the question change by the time the report is ready**
* 🔴 **Missing critical patterns in returns, discounting, and regional performance that are eroding margins, but BI dashboards require knowing exactly what to look for beforehand**
* 🔴 **Unable to quickly identify which product categories, channels, or regions need immediate attention during monthly business reviews, leading to reactive decision-making and missed opportunities**

## 3. The Solution: Assay Autonomous Analyst
We don't just "show data". We solve the problem.

### Step 1: 1. Ask: 'Assay, what's impacting our revenue performance this month?'
- **Action**: Assay autonomously analyzes revenue trends across product_category, region, channel, and time—then surfaces: 'Electronics revenue is down 18% vs. last month, driven primarily by West region In-Store channel. However, Online channel is up 12%, suggesting a customer preference shift.'
- **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: No manual pivot tables or pre-built dashboards needed. Assay automatically identifies the multi-dimensional story behind the numbers and presents it in plain English in seconds.

### Step 2: 2. Ask: 'Which products should I be worried about?'
- **Action**: Assay correlates is_returned, customer_rating, discount_pct, and revenue to flag: 'Books category has a 23% return rate with average rating of 2.8—highest return rate across all categories. Despite 15% average discounts, revenue per order is declining, suggesting a quality or assortment issue.'
- **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: Assay connects dots across multiple metrics that would require 3-4 different reports. It doesn't just show returns are high—it explains WHY it matters to your P&L and what else is correlated.

### Step 3: 3. Ask: 'Are our discounts actually working?'
- **Action**: Assay segments orders by discount_pct ranges and analyzes revenue, units_sold, and customer_rating: 'Orders with 10-15% discounts generate 2.1x more revenue than 20%+ discounts, with identical customer ratings (3.9). You're leaving margin on the table—optimal discount appears to be 8-12%.'
- **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: This is the analysis that typically requires a data science project. Assay delivers actionable pricing intelligence instantly, showing exactly where you're over-discounting without ROI.

### Step 4: 4. Ask: 'What should I focus on this week?'
- **Action**: Assay prioritizes: '1) South region has 8.2 days_to_ship vs. 3.1 company avg—correlates with 31% lower customer_rating. 2) Online channel revenue up 22% but units_sold only up 8%—investigate product mix shift. 3) Customer #1435 placed 47 orders totaling $18K—potential VIP program candidate.'
- **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: Instead of staring at dashboards wondering what matters, Assay acts as your chief of staff—triaging what needs attention NOW with context on why it's important and what action to take.
