# 🚀 Minerva Sales Kit: Retail & E-commerce

> **Use Case**: Autonomous Sales Performance Analytics for Multi-Category Retailers
> **Target Persona**: VP of Sales / Head of Retail Operations

## 1. The Executive Pitch

Minerva eliminates the manual grind of sales reporting by autonomously monitoring your daily sales performance across all categories, surfacing anomalies, trends, and actionable insights in plain English—before you even ask. Instead of building dashboards, your team gets intelligent alerts and answers on-demand, freeing up 20+ hours per week to focus on driving revenue, not chasing data.

## 2. The Pain Points (Why they buy)

* 🔴 **Spending 15+ hours weekly manually pulling sales reports from multiple sources, only to present stale data that's already outdated by the time leadership sees it**
* 🔴 **Missing critical sales anomalies and category performance shifts until it's too late—discovering underperforming categories only after quarterly reviews when margins have already eroded**
* 🔴 **Drowning in spreadsheets and static dashboards that require constant manual updates, leaving no time for strategic decisions or proactive inventory/promotion planning**

## 3. The Solution: Minerva Autonomous Analyst

We don't just "show data". We solve the problem.

### 💰 ROI & Business Impact

* 🟢 Save 20+ hours per week previously spent on manual reporting, data pulls, and dashboard updates

## 4. The Golden Demo Script

*Use the dataset `test_sales.csv` for this demo.*

### Step 1: 1. Ask: 'How are my sales performing across categories this week compared to last week?'

- **Action**: Minerva instantly analyzes the Date, Sales, and Category columns, aggregates weekly performance, calculates week-over-week growth rates for each category, and presents a clear summary with visual trends
* **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: No SQL, no pivot tables, no waiting for BI team—instant answer with context. The VP sees Category A up 8%, Category B down 12% in seconds, not hours.

### Step 2: 2. Ask: 'Alert me to any unusual sales patterns or anomalies'

- **Action**: Minerva autonomously detects statistical outliers—like a sudden 40% drop in Category B on a specific date—and surfaces it with context: 'Category B sales dropped significantly on Jan 15th, 30% below the 7-day average'
* **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: Proactive intelligence without setting up complex rules. Minerva catches revenue risks before they become quarterly disasters, acting like a 24/7 analyst watching every metric.

### Step 3: 3. Ask: 'Which category is my best performer and what's driving the trend?'

- **Action**: Minerva ranks categories by total sales, growth rate, and consistency, then provides narrative insights: 'Category A leads with $45K total sales and steady 5% weekly growth. Category B shows volatility with 3 significant dips in the past month'
* **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: Turns raw data into strategic narrative. The VP can walk into exec meetings with confidence, armed with insights—not just numbers—without spending a weekend in Excel.

### Step 4: 4. Set up: 'Monitor daily sales and notify me if any category drops more than 15% day-over-day'

- **Action**: Minerva creates an autonomous monitoring agent that watches sales performance 24/7, sending Slack/email alerts only when thresholds are breached, with full context and suggested drill-down questions
* **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: Replaces manual daily report checking with intelligent automation. The VP stays ahead of problems while sleeping—Minerva never misses a shift, never takes vacation, and always provides context with alerts.
