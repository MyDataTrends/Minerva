# 🚀 Minerva Sales Kit: Retail & E-commerce

> **Use Case**: Autonomous Sales Performance Intelligence for Retail Leaders
> **Target Persona**: VP of Sales / Head of Revenue Operations

## 1. The Executive Pitch
Minerva eliminates the manual grind of sales reporting by autonomously monitoring your revenue data 24/7, instantly surfacing anomalies, trends, and category performance shifts before they impact your bottom line. Instead of building dashboards, you get executive-ready insights delivered in plain English—so you can focus on strategy, not spreadsheets.

## 2. The Pain Points (Why they buy)
* 🔴 **Spending 15+ hours weekly manually pulling sales reports from multiple sources, only to present stale data that's already outdated by the time leadership sees it**
* 🔴 **Missing critical sales anomalies (sudden drops in specific categories, emerging trends) until it's too late to course-correct, leading to missed revenue targets and painful QBR conversations**
* 🔴 **Drowning in spreadsheets and static dashboards that show WHAT happened but never explain WHY, forcing them to play detective instead of strategist**

## 3. The Solution: Minerva Autonomous Analyst
We don't just "show data". We solve the problem.

### 💰 ROI & Business Impact
* 🟢 Save 15-20 hours per week previously spent on manual reporting and data wrangling
* 🟢 Reduce time-to-insight from days to seconds, enabling 3x faster response to revenue threats
* 🟢 Eliminate 'surprise' revenue misses by catching category-level anomalies 48-72 hours earlier
* 🟢 Increase revenue team productivity by 25% as analysts shift from reporting to strategic analysis

## 4. The Golden Demo Script
*Use the dataset `test_sales.csv` for this demo.*

### Step 1: 1. Ask: 'What's happening with my sales performance this week?'
- **Action**: Minerva instantly analyzes Date and Sales columns, identifies a 15% week-over-week growth trend, and highlights that January 15-20 showed unusual acceleration
- **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: No SQL, no dashboard building—just conversational intelligence. What used to take 2 hours in Excel happens in 3 seconds.

### Step 2: 2. Ask: 'Which categories are driving or dragging performance?'
- **Action**: Minerva segments sales by Category, reveals that Category A is up 22% while Category B has declined 8% over the past 30 days, and flags this divergence as statistically significant
- **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: Automatically surfaces the 'why' behind the numbers—no pivot tables, no guesswork. The VP immediately knows where to double down and where to investigate.

### Step 3: 3. Ask: 'Alert me if any category drops more than 10% day-over-day'
- **Action**: Minerva sets up an autonomous monitoring rule and will proactively Slack/email the VP the moment an anomaly occurs—before the Monday morning leadership call
- **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: Shifts from reactive reporting to proactive intelligence. The VP becomes the person who spots problems first, not last.

### Step 4: 4. Ask: 'Create an executive summary for my board update'
- **Action**: Minerva generates a narrative insight: 'Sales grew 18% MTD driven by Category A strength (+22%), offsetting Category B softness (-8%). Key risk: Category B shows 3-day consecutive decline starting Jan 18—recommend immediate channel review.'
- **✨ The 'Wow' Factor**: Board-ready insights in seconds, not hours of PowerPoint prep. The VP walks into meetings armed with context, not just charts.
