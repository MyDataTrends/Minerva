TITLE: Built Assay – a local-first AI data analyst that does the full pipeline (cleaning → modeling → SHAP → insights) without sending data to the cloud

BODY:

Hey r/MachineLearning! 

I've been working on **Assay** – think of it as having a junior data analyst that runs entirely on your machine. You drop in a CSV, and it autonomously handles cleaning, profiling, trains models (LightGBM/XGBoost/Ridge), generates SHAP explanations, and gives you natural language insights.

**Why I built this:** Got tired of the repetitive "load data → clean → EDA → model → explain" cycle, especially when working with sensitive data where cloud solutions aren't an option. Wanted something that just... does the work.

**What's new in this release:**
- Interactive dashboard that combines chat + analysis + orchestration
- AI agent framework for domain-specific tasks (marketing insights, customer support analysis, etc.)
- Smarter chat that actually understands context when you ask follow-ups
- Auto-suggests the best analysis approach for your data

Everything runs locally – no API keys, no data leaving your machine. It's opinionated about the ML pipeline but lets you customize when needed.

**Current limitations:** Works best with tabular data (CSVs), models are limited to the gradient boosting + linear family, and NL generation can be hit-or-miss depending on data complexity.

Curious what the community thinks – is this solving a real pain point or just automating something that should stay manual? Also open to suggestions on what analysis types to add next.

Happy to answer questions about the architecture or design choices!
