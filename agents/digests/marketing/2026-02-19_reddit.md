TITLE: Built Minerva – a local-first AI data analyst that actually explains what it finds (now with chat interface)

BODY:

Hey everyone! I've been working on Minerva, a privacy-focused alternative to cloud analytics tools. You upload a CSV, and it autonomously handles the full pipeline: cleaning, profiling, modeling (LightGBM/XGBoost/Ridge), SHAP explanations, and natural language insights. Everything runs locally – no data leaves your machine.

**What's new in this release:**

- **AI chat interface** – ask questions about your data in plain English instead of wrestling with SQL or pandas
- **Intelligent tool selection** – the agent framework picks the right analysis methods based on your question
- **Unified dashboard** – all features in one place instead of scattered across tabs

The goal was to eliminate the "analyst request queue" problem. Instead of waiting days for someone to slice your data by region/category/time, you just ask "why are returns spiking in the Northeast?" and get model-backed answers with feature importance.

I built this initially for retail/e-commerce use cases (revenue analysis, margin breakdown, operational issues), but it works with any tabular data. The local-first approach means it's useful for sensitive datasets where cloud upload isn't an option.

**Would love feedback on:**
- What analysis tasks do you find yourself repeating manually?
- Is the "autonomous analyst" framing useful, or does it oversell what's realistic?
- Other domains where this workflow would be valuable?

GitHub and demo in comments. Happy to answer questions about the architecture or agent design choices.
