TITLE: Show HN: Minerva – Local-first AI data analyst with chat interface and autonomous agents

BODY:

I built Minerva to scratch my own itch: analyzing CSV data without writing code or waiting for dashboards to load.

**What it does:**
Upload a CSV and ask questions in plain English. "What's driving returns?" "Which regions have shipping delays?" "Show me products with declining margins." Minerva picks the right analysis tools, runs them, and explains what it found.

**What's new in this release:**
- Conversational chat interface for data questions
- Agent framework that autonomously selects analysis methods (statistical tests, clustering, anomaly detection, etc.)
- Four deployment modes: Streamlit dashboard, FastAPI backend, CLI, and MCP server
- Everything runs locally—your data never leaves your machine

**Technical details:**
The agent system coordinates multiple specialized tools: data profiling, missing value analysis, outlier detection, correlation analysis, and ML modeling. It uses LLM function calling to chain operations based on your question. The MCP server integration means you can use it from Claude Desktop or other MCP clients.

Built with Python, runs on commodity hardware. No cloud dependencies, no API keys required (though you can plug in OpenAI/Anthropic if you want). Uses local models by default.

**Why local-first matters:**
I've worked with teams that can't upload sensitive data to cloud analytics tools. Minerva processes everything on your laptop. Useful for finance, healthcare, or anyone with compliance requirements.

Still early—there are rough edges and the agent sometimes picks suboptimal analysis paths. But it's useful enough that I'm using it daily, and I think others building data tools or needing quick analysis might find it interesting.

Code is open source. Would love feedback on the agent architecture and what analysis capabilities would be most useful.
