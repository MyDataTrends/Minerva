TITLE: Show HN: Minerva – Local-first AI data analyst with conversational interface

BODY:

I built Minerva to be the data analyst I wish I had on every project – one that actually runs on your machine and doesn't send your CSVs to someone else's cloud.

**What it does:**
Drop in a CSV and Minerva autonomously cleans it, profiles the data, builds models, and surfaces insights. The new conversational interface lets you ask questions in plain English ("why did sales drop in Q3?") and it plans out the analysis steps, picks the right visualizations, and generates answers.

**What's interesting technically:**
- Smart task planning: breaks down vague requests into concrete analysis steps
- Tool selection: automatically chooses between statistical tests, ML models, or visualizations based on your question
- Multiple interfaces: runs as a Streamlit dashboard, FastAPI backend, CLI tool, or MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
- Actually local-first: your data never leaves your machine

**Recent updates:**
- Added conversational UI that understands context across questions
- Expanded data source connectors (prioritized by what data scientists actually use)
- Security patches for dependencies

**Why I built this:**
Every data project starts the same way: load CSV, check for nulls, plot distributions, run correlations. I got tired of writing the same EDA notebooks. Minerva automates the boring parts so you can focus on the interesting questions.

It's zero-config by design – no YAML files, no pipeline definitions. Just point it at data and start asking questions.

Available as open source. Works with pandas DataFrames under the hood, so it's easy to extend or integrate into existing workflows.

Would love feedback, especially from folks doing regular data analysis work. What would make this more useful for your workflow?
