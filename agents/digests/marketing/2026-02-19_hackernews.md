TITLE: Show HN: Assay – Local-first AI data analyst with agents, chat, and MCP server

BODY:

I built Assay to handle the repetitive parts of data analysis locally. You point it at a CSV, and it autonomously cleans, profiles, models, and extracts insights without sending data anywhere.

**What it does:**

- Cleans messy data (handles missing values, outliers, encoding issues)
- Profiles datasets (distributions, correlations, anomalies)
- Builds models (regression, classification, clustering depending on your data)
- Runs as multiple interfaces: Streamlit dashboard, FastAPI backend, CLI, or MCP server

**What's new in this release:**

The big addition is an AI agent framework. Instead of just running one-off analyses, you can now set up agents for specific tasks like monitoring marketing performance, analyzing support tickets, or tracking usage patterns. They work autonomously on your local data.

I also added a unified dashboard that combines chat, analysis results, and orchestration. The chat interface lets you ask questions about your data in plain English, and it maintains context across the conversation.

The system now suggests which analysis to run based on your data structure, so you spend less time configuring and more time getting results.

**Technical details:**

Everything runs locally—no API calls with your data. It's built on Streamlit for the UI, FastAPI for the backend API, and supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) so it can integrate with other tools. Zero config to get started.

I originally built this because I was tired of writing the same data cleaning scripts over and over. Figured others might have the same problem.

Open to feedback, especially on the agent framework—curious what use cases people would want to automate.
